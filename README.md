## Project Overview

## What I Did

### Button 1 
- has a simple background and text color change when hovered over.

### Button 2 
- inspired by button number 5 from the curated buttons, it has a top border that expands from left to right and a bottom border that expands from right to left. It also has a color change to the background and text.

### Button 3 
- also inspired by curated button number 10, but instead of the animation filling the button it shrinks till its invisible. When hoverd over the background colors are inverted and the text color is changed.
